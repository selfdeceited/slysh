# Slysh

_Slysh_ is a simple ~~and a bit arrogant~~ self time-management tracker done as a Chrome extension.

Currently only RU language is supported.

## Local development

create a file `./src/secret_key.js` with content like:

```js
export const apiKey = "<your-api-key>";
export const storeUri = "<your-data-storage>";
```

I use [restdb.io](https://restdb.io/)
