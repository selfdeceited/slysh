# Slysh

_Slysh_ is a simple ~~and a bit arrogant~~ self time-management tracker done as a Chrome extension.

Currently only RU language is supported.

## Local development

```
yarn dev
```

## Real usage (by now)

1. set your `.env` with remote server you need. I use [restdb.io](https://restdb.io/)
2. `yarn build`
3. Load `./public` to Chrome [as unpacked extension](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)
