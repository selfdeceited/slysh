# Slysh

_Slysh_ is a simple ~~and a bit arrogant~~ self time-management tracker done as a Chrome extension.

Currently only RU language is supported.

## Local development

create a file `./src/secret_key.ts` with content like:

```js
export const apiKey = "<your-api-key>"
export const storeUri = "<your-data-storage>"
export const devMode = false
```

I use [restdb.io](https://restdb.io/)
